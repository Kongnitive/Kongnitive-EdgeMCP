# TODO

- [ ] Encryption is not fully implemented yet: complete and validate end-to-end encryption for MCP communication (HTTPS/WSS TLS), including certificate management and rotation.
- [ ] Network configuration is not flexible enough: support runtime network parameter updates (for example Wi-Fi credentials, static IP, and multi-network strategy) with a clear configuration entry point.
- [ ] OTA has not been fully tested yet: run end-to-end OTA update and rollback validation on real devices.
